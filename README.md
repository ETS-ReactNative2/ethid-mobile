# ŒûID Mobile

ŒûID Mobile is an Open Source Decentralized Identity application. Crafted for smartphones.

### ‚ö†Ô∏èüöß Under Construction üöß‚ö†Ô∏è

The current repo was prototyped over a weekend. The primary focus was to create the navigation, routes and include the 3 major dependencies: IdentityWallet, WalletConnect and Ethers.

### What

An Experiment to understand decentralized identity in the mobile environment. The experiment seeks to understand what is the optimal method(s) to onboard new users into a decentralized environment. The verifiable credential part of decentralized is new, and explored territory. A lot can be learned from a feature driven, MIT license project. The project is MIT licensed to promote contributions and forks.

- Optimal Decentralized Identity Onboarding
- Peer-to-Peer Verifiable Credentials
- Multi-IPFS Hub Support and Linking
- 3ID Standard Experimentation
- Burner/Delegate Key System
- Multi-Device Communication (WalletConnect)

### Why

A number of reasons. A big reason being 3Box has released the `identity-wallet` module and, in general starting to mature the core decentralized identity features: authentication, storage and communication. It's a great time to be a Web3 Developer.

The primary reason is I just want a really great decentralized identity wallet. A completely open and free to use codebase that will let me extend, experiment and invite new contributors.

## How

Free time. Passion. Built to be Open and Evolve with the new emerging 3ID standard. Fork the code, use the modules and compose together decentralized identity mobile applications.
